# DattaBot

A novel AI agent/model from "scratch" (using libraries like pytorch). MAY try other approaches, like doing it in rust, if it serves value.

# How to interact with bot (run either of them)

For windows:
`.\run.bat`

For linux/mac:
`./run.sh`

Run python client:
`python client.py`

For information on python virtual environment: [notes.md](notes.md)

# Motivation

-   Have fun learning more about AI
-   Read/learn/implement papers (and any form of research)
-   Contribute back all of this research and implementation back to the community

# Goals

-   Fully open source - weights and all
-   Accessible to anyone and everyone, and can run on their own machines (don't need to hit an endpoint or give data away to a third party)
-   Make it work well on 1 single gpu (yes, just 1)
-   Make it the one of the best agents/models in the world
-   To make the above true we have to find novel ideas
